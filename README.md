# jda-repo
This repository is a consolidation of all my Discord Bot projects.

# Foundation
Foundation is not bot in and of itself, but it is a set of classes that gives a foundation (hence the name) for the other bots that I have. All of my bots stem from this project.

Foundation has now been moved to its own repository, jda-foundation. All three of the bots listed here use and implemenet Foundation's code. Please refer to jda-foundation for more information.

# DBGM - Discord Bot General Manager
DBGM is my experimental bot. All ideas I have for a bot usually start here. The idea of this bot was to be the one bot that I used to do anything that I needed to do so that I didn't clutter my servers with a bunch of one-task bots. Also, it gives me a ton of practice on new concepts that I haven't messed with before.

# DND - Dungeons and Dragons
This bot is a bit old, but I still update it from time to time. Before, it was meant as a utility to manage a DND Discord server I hosted a while back. While it's no longer in use, I still append to it from time to time and keep the code clean just in case that server is ever revived.

# CSTeam - Computer Science
This is probably my oldest bot that I created. I made it for my school's computer science team to keep track of when the next contest was and a couple other small things. It is out of use, but for some reason I keep updating it.
